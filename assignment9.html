<h3><a id="1">  Computer</a> </h3>
	<a href="#top" >back to top </a>

	<p> A computer is a general purpose device that can be carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations.<br>
		<h5>  <a id="2">cpu</a> </h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		  <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p><br>
		<h5> <a id="3"> ALU</a></h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		  <p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer. An ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.</p>

<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		<h5> <a id="5"> c </a></h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		   <p>C (/siÀê/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.</p>
		<h5> <a id="6"> C++</a> </h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		   <p> C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style.</p>
<h3> <a id="7"> DBMS</a> </h3>
<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		<h5> <a id="8" >RDBMS</a></h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		  <p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</p>
		<h5> <a od="9">OODBMS</a></h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		  <p>OODBMS stands for Object-Oriented Database Management System. An object-oriented database management system (also known simply as an object database ) is a DBMS where data is represented in the form of objects, as used in object-oriented programming</p>
		<h5> <a id="10"> HDBMS</a></h5>
		<a href="#top" >back to top </a>
		   <p>HDBMS Hierarchical Database Management System. A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.</p>
